**Total Duration**: ~2 minutes (1:50 - 2:00)
**Word Count**: ~280 words

## SCENE 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:15)
**[Screen: Show a complex Grafana dashboard with many panels]**

> Every DevOps engineer knows this pain.
> 
> You have hundreds of Prometheus metrics, but creating a Grafana dashboard takes hours.
> 
> You need to understand metric types, write PromQL queries, and design panel layouts — all manually.

---

## SCENE 2: The Solution (0:15 - 0:30)
**[Screen: Show the app landing page / Step 1 with empty input]**

> What if AI could do this in seconds?
> 
> Introducing Prometheus to Grafana AI — powered by Gemini 3 Pro.
> 
> Just paste your metrics, and let AI generate a production-ready dashboard for you.

---

## SCENE 3: Demo - Input Metrics (0:30 - 0:50)
**[Screen: Paste sample metrics, show auto-parsing on the right panel]**

> Let me show you how it works.
> 
> I paste raw Prometheus metrics here. The app instantly parses them — showing me 42 metrics across 4 types: counters, gauges, histograms, and summaries.
> 
> No configuration needed. Just paste and go.

---

## SCENE 4: Demo - AI Analysis (0:50 - 1:10)
**[Screen: Click "Analyze", show loading, then Plan Editor with panel cards]**

> Now I click Analyze. Gemini 3 Pro reads the metrics and generates a dashboard plan.
> 
> It suggests panel titles, visualization types, and even PromQL queries — all based on metric semantics.
> 
> I can edit any panel, change the chart type, or remove panels I don't need.

---

## SCENE 5: Demo - Generate & Preview (1:10 - 1:30)
**[Screen: Click "Generate", show loading, then Dashboard Preview with charts]**

> One click to generate. The AI creates valid Grafana JSON with proper panel layouts.
> 
> Here's a live preview — time series charts, stat panels, even histograms.
> 
> I can download the JSON or copy it directly to clipboard.

---

## SCENE 6: Demo - Import to Grafana (1:30 - 1:45)
**[Screen: Show Grafana import dialog, then the final dashboard]**

> Finally, I import it into Grafana. Select my Prometheus datasource, and done.
> 
> A complete dashboard — created in under a minute.

---

## SCENE 7: Closing (1:45 - 2:00)
**[Screen: Show app logo or summary slide]**

> Prometheus to Grafana AI — powered by Gemini 3 Pro.
> 
> Ten times faster. Zero PromQL expertise needed. Production-ready output.
